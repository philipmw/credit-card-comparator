INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Copy this whole directory to within your web server's document root and name
   it as you wish.  My personal path is /~pmw/ccc.

2) Configure the web server to treat ccc as a CGI directory such that files
   with extension .py are executable.  If you use Apache httpd, use .htaccess.

3) The program needs a directory on your filesystem that's both writable by
   your user and readable by the web server.  This directory is used for
   generating and storing charts which are then displayed to the user.
   Create this directory and set its permissions, then edit Settings.py and
   specify the paths to it.

4) Optionally create a cronjob to clean the temporary directory.  The program
   intentionally does not erase images once they were created, in case you
   wish to allow users to hotlink to their personalized charts.
   Warning: the growth of this directory is uncontrolled.
